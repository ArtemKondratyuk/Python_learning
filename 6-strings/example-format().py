# name = "Lisa"
# age = 37
# massage = f"My name is {name} and I'm {age} yaers old!"
# print(massage)         # My name is Lisa and I'm 37 yaers old!


# Task 1

# Task: Write a program that asks for the user's name, age, and city of residence,
# and then outputs a message using the format() method in this form:
# Hi, my name is Alex! I am 30 years old and I live in Kiev.


# name = "Alex"
# age = 30
# city = "Kiev"
# print(f"Hi, my name is {name}! I am {age} yaers old and I live in {city}.")    

# Output: Hi, my name is Alex! I am 30 yaers old and I live in Kiev.



# Task 2

# Write a program that takes three numbers from a user, calculates their sum 
# and average, and then outputs the result using the format() method in this form:
# You entered the numbers: 5, 10, 15. Their sum is 30 and the average is 10.0

# a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# b = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# c = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# summa = a + b + c
# average = summa / 3
# print(f"You entered the numbers: {a}, {b}, {c}. Their sum is {summa} and the average is {average:.1f}")

# output: You entered the numbers: 5, 10, 15. Their sum is 30 and the average is 10.0
